# Unhandled Exception: Division by Zero in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript: failing to gracefully handle potential runtime exceptions, in this specific case, division by zero.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version that uses try-catch to handle the error and prevent application crashes.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in production-ready code.  Ignoring potential exceptions can lead to unexpected application behavior and failures.
